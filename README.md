# üõ°Ô∏è My Personal Cybersecurity Wake-Up Call

**Date of Incident:** July 10‚Äì13, 2025 <br>
**Type of Attack:** Scareware notifications <br>
**Written on:** July 18, 2025

## üìå Context

In the days leading up to my Discrete Mathematics exam on July 15, I was online searching for model papers. On July 10, I unknowingly clicked a suspicious link ‚Äî a decision that led to an eye-opening cybersecurity experience.

## What Happened

- **Pop-Up Storm:**  
    I began receiving constant pop-ups warning me that:
  - My laptop was infected with _5 viruses_
  - My **McAfee antivirus subscription had expired**
- **Immediate Doubt:**  
    I remembered having purchased a **3-year McAfee subscription in December 2024**, valid through December 2027. My **firewall was also active**, so something felt off.
- **Contacted McAfee customer support for clarification:**
  - I called both the **Billing team** and the **Technical team** 
  - The billing team verified my subscription was **active and valid**
  - The technical team confirmed these were **scam pop-ups** ‚Äî classic examples of **social engineering techniques** meant to scare users into buying fake "protection"

## My Response

### 1. Initial but impulsive reaction (but useful learning):

I took the following actions across **both Chrome and Edge** browsers:

- Cleared all history, cache, cookies, and site data
- Disabled site notifications from multiple websites
- Disabled all cookies and preferences (which later backfired)

 **Side Effects of this reaction:**  
Disabling cookies meant my login sessions were wiped every time I closed a website. I had to re-enter credentials constantly. This led to frustration ‚Äî but this step taught me how crucial balanced privacy settings are.

### 2. Fixing It & Securing My System:**

- **Re-enabled Cookies/Preferences** ‚Äî restored normal functionality like saved logins.
- **Enhanced Security on Browsers:**

| **Browser**        | **Security Actions Taken**                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Google Chrome**  |  Enabled **Enhanced Protection** (real-time AI-based protection against malicious sites) <br> Enabled **Google Public DNS** <br> Enabled **Secure connection** for insecure public sites <br> Enabled **Warnings** if a password was compromised in a data breach |
| **Microsoft Edge** |  Enabled **OpenDNS** (Cisco‚Äôs secure DNS) <br> Enabled **"Scareware Blocker"** (detects fake tech alert scams) <br> Switched on **"Enhanced Security on the Web"** with _Balanced_ mode |

## What I Learned

1. **Pop-up scams are psychological traps**, not just technical ones. Their goal is fear ‚Äî not infection.
2. **Antivirus software alone is not enough.** Your browser settings and DNS setup matter just as much.
3. **Blindly clearing everything can break useful things.** Understand the settings before toggling them.
4. **Google Chrome‚Äôs enhanced protection is noticeably stronger** than Microsoft Edge‚Äôs default protection ‚Äî but Edge can be hardened too, with the right practices.
5. **Secure DNS** (like OpenDNS or Google public DNS) is a simple but powerful security layer that‚Äôs often overlooked.
6. **Always verify alarming messages with official support** ‚Äî especially when money is involved.

## Final Setup Summary

| **Component**      | **Protection Enabled**                             |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **System-wide**    |  McAfee (valid subscription) <br> Active firewall |
| **Google Chrome**  |  Enhanced Protection <br> Google Public DNS <br> Secure connections <br> warnings for password breach  |
| **Microsoft Edge** |  OpenDNS <br> Enhanced Web Security (Balanced mode) <br> Scareware Blocker |

## Why This Matters

This wasn‚Äôt just about cleaning up my browser ‚Äî it was a lesson in **digital hygiene**, **critical thinking**, **and** **taking ownership of my tech environment**. It also made me more aware of **how human psychology is the weakest link** in security ‚Äî and how scammers exploit that with precision.

## Key Takeaway

**Stay calm. Stay curious. Trust, but verify.**  
*Cybersecurity isn't just technical ‚Äî it's emotional too.*
