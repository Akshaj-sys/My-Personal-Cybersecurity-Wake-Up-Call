**üõ°Ô∏è My Personal Cybersecurity Wake-Up Call**

**Date of Incident:** July 10‚Äì15, 2025  
**Written on:** July 18, 2025

**üìå Context**

In the days leading up to my Discrete Mathematics exam on July 15, I was online searching for model papers. On July 10, I unknowingly clicked a suspicious link ‚Äî a decision that led to an eye-opening cybersecurity experience.

** What Happened**

- **Pop-Up Storm:**  
    I began receiving constant pop-ups warning me that:
  - My laptop was infected with _5 viruses_
  - My **McAfee antivirus subscription had expired**
- **Immediate Doubt:**  
    I remembered having purchased a **3-year McAfee subscription in December 2024**, valid through **December 2027**. My **firewall was also active**, so something felt off.
- **Contacted McAfee Support:**
  - Called both the **Billing** and **Technical** teams
  - They verified my subscription was **active and valid**
  - Confirmed these were **scam pop-ups** ‚Äî classic examples of **social engineering** meant to scare users into buying fake "protection"

** My Response**

**1\. Initial Overreaction (but useful learning):**

I took the following actions across **both Chrome and Edge** browsers:

- Cleared all history, cache, cookies, and site data
- Disabled site notifications from multiple websites
- Disabled all cookies and preferences (which later backfired)

 **Side Effect:**  
Disabling cookies meant my login sessions were wiped every time I closed a website. I had to re-enter credentials constantly. This led to frustration ‚Äî but taught me how crucial balanced privacy settings are.

**2\. Fixing It & Securing My System:**

- **Re-enabled Cookies/Preferences**  
    which restored normal functionality like saved logins
- **Enhanced Security on Browsers:**

| **Browser**        | **Security Actions Taken**                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Google Chrome**  |  Enabled **Enhanced Protection** (real-time AI-based protection against malicious sites)  <br> Enabled **Google Public DNS**  <br> Enabled **Secure connection ** for insecure public sites <br> Enabled **warnings** if a password was compromised in a data breach |
| **Microsoft Edge** |  Enabled **OpenDNS** (Cisco‚Äôs secure DNS)  <br> Enabled **"Scareware Blocker"** (detects fake tech alert scams)  <br> Switched on **"Enhanced Security on the Web"** with _Balanced_ mode |

** What I Learned**

1. **Pop-up scams are psychological traps**, not just technical ones. Their goal is fear ‚Äî not infection.
2. **Antivirus software alone is not enough.** Your browser settings and DNS setup matter just as much.
3. **Blindly clearing everything can break useful things.** Understand the settings before toggling them.
4. **Google Chrome‚Äôs enhanced protection is noticeably stronger** than Microsoft Edge‚Äôs default ‚Äî but Edge can be hardened too, with the right tweaks.
5. **Secure DNS** (like OpenDNS or Google DNS) is a simple but powerful security layer that‚Äôs often overlooked.
6. **Always verify alarming messages with official support** ‚Äî especially when money is involved.

** Final Setup Summary**

| **Component**      | **Protection Enabled**           |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **System-wide**    |  McAfee (valid subscription)  <br> Active firewall |
| **Google Chrome**  |  Enhanced Protection  <br> Google Public DNS  <br> Secure connections  <br> warnings for password breach  |
| **Microsoft Edge** |  OpenDNS  <br> Enhanced Web Security (Balanced mode)  <br> Scareware Blocker |

** Why This Matters**

This wasn‚Äôt just about cleaning up my browser ‚Äî it was a lesson in **digital hygiene**, **critical thinking**, **and** **taking ownership of my tech environment**. It also made me more aware of **how human psychology is the weakest link** in security ‚Äî and how scammers exploit that with precision.

** Key Takeaway**

**Stay calm. Stay curious. Trust, but verify.**  
**Cybersecurity isn't just technical ‚Äî it's emotional too.**
